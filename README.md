# Magic Modules

**Add Google Cloud Platform support to Terraform**

Magic Modules is a code generation framework that automatically generates Terraform providers for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. This repository contains the tooling and templates needed to generate, test, and maintain GCP Terraform provider code.

## 📋 Overview

Magic Modules is a fork of the [GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules) project. It provides an automated approach to creating and maintaining Terraform provider code for GCP services, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency across provider implementations.
