# Notes:
# - Lines are "pattern <owners...>" where pattern is a file path or glob and owners
#   are GitHub usernames, teams (org/team), or email addresses.
# - GitHub resolves the first matching pattern from top to bottom; place more specific
#   patterns above less-specific ones if you need overrides.
